## Reporting a Vulnerability

The NCTIRS Dashboard is a critical national security application. We take security vulnerabilities extremely seriously.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them privately:

1. **Email**: Send details to the security team (contact maintainers for email)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" option in the Security tab

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Initial Response | Within 24 hours |
| Status Update | Within 72 hours |
| Resolution Target | 7-14 days (severity dependent) |

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment** - We'll confirm receipt within 24 hours
2. **Assessment** - We'll investigate and determine severity
3. **Resolution** - We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure** - We'll coordinate public disclosure timing with you
